# Module 1: Introduction to Azure

## Overview of Cloud Computing

### Definition and Principles of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet, providing on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. The key principles of cloud computing include:

- **On-demand Self-Service:** Users can provision computing resources as needed without human intervention.
- **Broad Network Access:** Services are accessible over the network and can be accessed through standard mechanisms.
- **Resource Pooling:** Computing resources are pooled and shared among multiple users, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned.
- **Rapid Elasticity:** Resources can be rapidly and elastically provisioned or released, allowing for scalability based on demand.
- **Measured Service:** Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use, providing transparency for both the provider and the consumer regarding usage and costs.

## Cloud Service Models

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

**Definition:** Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It enables users to rent virtual machines and other computing resources on a pay-as-you-go basis.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Virtual Machines:** Users have control over virtualized instances of computing resources.
- **Storage:** IaaS includes scalable and flexible storage options.
- **Networking:** Users can configure and manage network components.

**Example: Azure Virtual Machines (VMs)**
Azure VMs allow users to deploy and manage virtualized Windows or Linux servers in the cloud. Users have full control over the VM's configuration, allowing for flexibility in running applications, hosting websites, and more.

### Platform as a Service (PaaS)

**Definition:** Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model that provides a platform allowing users to develop, run, and manage applications without dealing with the complexity of underlying infrastructure.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Application Development:** PaaS simplifies the application development process by providing tools and services.
- **Scalability:** Users can scale applications easily without managing the underlying infrastructure.
- **Automated Management:** Infrastructure management is abstracted, allowing focus on application development.

**Example: Azure App Services**
Azure App Services is a PaaS offering that enables users to build, deploy, and scale web apps quickly. It supports various programming languages and frameworks, allowing developers to focus on coding without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

### Software as a Service (SaaS)

**Definition:** Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud computing model that delivers software applications over the internet. Users can access the software without the need to install, manage, or maintain it locally.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Accessibility:** Software is accessible through a web browser, eliminating the need for local installations.
- **Automatic Updates:** Updates and maintenance are handled by the service provider.
- **Multi-Tenancy:** SaaS applications serve multiple users from a shared infrastructure.

**Example: Microsoft 365**
Microsoft 365 is a SaaS offering that provides a suite of productivity tools, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and collaboration services like Teams. Users can access these applications from any device with an internet connection, making it a convenient and scalable solution for businesses.
